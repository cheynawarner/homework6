```{r}
#Library Packages
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(rio)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Import Data
star <- import(here("data", "star.csv")) %>%  
  clean_names()
```

To complete this homework, we are using several packages and R (@rio2023, @janitor2024, @here2020, @2023R)

```{r}
# Create a plot of teacher experience vs math scores
star |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = totexp, y = tmathss)) +
  geom_point(color = "darkgrey") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(color = frl)) +
  labs(x = "Teacher Experience (years)",
       y = "Total Math Scale Score",
       title = "Relation between teacher experience and math scores",
       subtitle = "Separate regression lines displayed by free/reduced price lunch status") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Lunch status", 
                      labels = c("Free/Reduced Price Meals", "Paid Meals")) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Based on the above figure, it seems that teacher experience has little to no effect on total math scale scores. However, we do see that students with free/reduced price meals have slightly better math scores than those students with paid meals.
